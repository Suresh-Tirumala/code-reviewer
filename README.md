# debugger

**debugger** is a high-performance, real-time code analysis and refactoring platform. It provides developers with an intelligent workspace for instant code reviews, automated refactoring, and interactive simulation, all wrapped in a sleek, modern interface.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Ultra-Low Latency Analysis**: Powered by **Gemini 3 Flash**, providing near-instant feedback on code quality, security, and performance.
- **AI Logo Synthesis**: Integrated identity generation using **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image**. Create and apply professional robot branding directly from the workspace settings.
- **Antigravity Background**: A high-performance, interactive 3D particle system built with **Three.js** and **React Three Fiber** that responds to user interaction.
- **Multimodal AI Assistant**: A persistent side-panel assistant featuring real-time chat and **Gemini 2.5 Flash TTS** for high-quality audio responses.
- **3D-Flip Secure Gateway**: A professional, secure authentication interface with optimized CSS 3D transitions.
- **Visual Preview Environment**: Real-time rendering for web-based code (HTML/CSS/SVG) within an integrated sandbox.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Vite
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js, @react-three/fiber
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **AI Intelligence**: Gemini API (Gemini 3 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Flash Image/TTS)
- **Utilities**: Highlight.js, Marked.js, FontAwesome 6
